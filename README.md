Employee Data base Handling

This Employee Data base Handling project is written in C++ and is used to manage the employee database which performs certain tasks like adding, deleting, displaying, searching, and modifying. Employees can be added based on their job titles, such as team lead, human resource, developer, or quality analyst. It incorporates design patterns such as singleton and factory method and it also ensures that any additional operations do not collapse the other implementation. The employee database will be updated into a file which can be used later to retrieve the database.

  Add a new employee for the required designation.
  Delete an employee using there employee id.
  Search for employees by using any number of queries.
  Display all the employee records.
